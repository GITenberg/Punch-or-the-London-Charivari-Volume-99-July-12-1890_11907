    <h2>VOCES POPULI.</h2>

    <h3>AT THE MILITARY EXHIBITION.</h3>

    <h4>IN THE AVENUE FACING THE ARENA.</h4>

    <p><i>An Unreasonable Old Lady</i> (<i>arriving breathless,
    with her grandson and niece</i>). This'll be the place the
    balloon goes up from, I wouldn't miss it for anything! Put the
    child up on that bench, MARIA; we'll stand about here till it
    begins.</p>

    <p><i>Maria</i>. But <i>I</i> don't see no balloon nor
    nothing.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Which, as the foliage blocks out all but the
        immediate foreground, is scarcely surprising.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The U.O.L.</i> No more don't I&mdash;but it stands to
    reason there wouldn't be so many looking on if there wasn't
    <i>something</i> to see. We're well enough where we are, and
    <i>I</i>'m not going further to fare worse to please nobody; so
    you may do as you <i>like</i> about it.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/13.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/13.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[MARIA <i>promptly avails herself of this
        permission.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The U.O.L.</i> (<i>a little later</i>). Well, it's time
    they did <i>something</i>, I'm sure. Why the people seem all
    moving off! and where's that girl MARIA got to? Ah, here you
    are! So you found you were no better off?&mdash;<i>Next</i>
    time, p'raps, you'll believe what I tell you. Not that there's
    any War Balloon as <i>I</i> can see!</p>

    <p><i>Maria</i>. Oh, there was a capital view from where
    <i>I</i> was&mdash;out in the open there.</p>

    <p><i>The U.O.L.</i> Why couldn't you say so before? Out in the
    open! Let's go there then&mdash;it's all the same to
    <i>me</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Maria</i> (<i>with an undutiful giggle</i>). It's all the
    same now&mdash;wherever you go, 'cause the balloon's gone
    up.</p>

    <p><i>The U.O.L.</i> Gone up! What are you telling me,
    MARIA?</p>

    <p><i>Maria</i>. I see it go&mdash;it shot up ever so fast and
    quite steady, and the people in the car all waved their 'ats to
    us. I could see a arm a waving almost till it got out of
    sight.</p>

    <p><i>The U.O.L.</i> And me and this innercent waiting here on
    the seat like lambs, and never dreaming what was goin' on! Oh,
    MARIA, however you'll reconcile it to your conscience, <i>I</i>
    don't know!</p>

    <p><i>Maria</i>. Why, whatever are you pitching into <i>me</i>
    for!</p>

    <p><i>The U.O.L.</i> It's not that it's any partickler pleasure
    to <i>me</i>, seeing a balloon, though we <i>did</i> get our
    tea done early to be in time for it&mdash;it's the sly
    deceitfulness of your <i>conduck</i>, MARIA, which is all the
    satisfaction I get for coming out with you,&mdash;it's the
    feeling that&mdash;well, there, I won't <i>talk</i> about
    it!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>In pursuance of which virtuous resolve, she talks
        about nothing else for the remainder of the day, until the
        unfortunate</i> MARIA <i>wishes fervently that balloons had
        never been invented.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>IN THE BUILDING.</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>An admiring group has collected before an enormous
        pin-cushion in the form of a fat star, and about the size
        of a Church-hassock.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>First Soldier</i> (<i>to his Companion</i>). Lot o' work
    in <i>that</i>, yer know!</p>

    <p><i>Second Soldier</i>. Yes. (<i>Thoughtfully</i>.) Not but
    what&mdash;(<i>becoming critical</i>)&mdash;if I'd been doin'
    it <i>myself</i>, I should ha' chose pins with smaller 'eds on
    'em.</p>

    <p><i>First S.</i> (<i>regarding this as presumptuous</i>). You
    may depend on it the man who made <i>that</i> 'ad his reasons
    for choosing the pins he did&mdash;but there's no pleasing some
    parties!</p>

    <p><i>Second S.</i> (<i>apologetically</i>). Well, I ain't
    denying the <i>Art</i> in it, am I?</p>

    <p><i>First Woman</i>. I <i>do</i> call that 'andsome, SARAH.
    See, there's a star, and two 'arps, and a crownd, and I don't
    know what all&mdash;and all done in pins and beads! "Made by
    Bandsman BROWN," too!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Reading placard.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Second W.</i> Soldiers is that clever with their 'ands.
    Four pounds seems a deal to ask for it, though.</p>

    <p><i>First W.</i> But look at the weeks it must ha' took him
    to do! (<i>Reading.</i>) "Containing between ten and eleven
    thousand pins and beads, and a hundred and ninety-eight pieces
    of coloured cloth!" Why, the pins alone must ha' cost a deal of
    money.</p>

    <p><i>Second W.</i> Yes, it 'ud be a pity for it to go to
    somebody as 'ud want to take 'em out.</p>

    <p><i>First W.</i> It ought to be bought up by Gover'ment, that
    it ought&mdash;they're well able to afford it.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>A select party of Philistines, comprising a young
        Man, apparently in the Army, and his</i> Mother <i>and</i>
        Sister, <i>are examining</i> Mr. GILBERT'S <i>Jubilee
        Trophy in a spirit of puzzled antipathy.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The Mother</i>. Dear me, and <i>that</i>'s the Jubilee
    centrepiece, is it? What a heavy-looking thing. I wonder what
    <i>that</i> cost?</p>

    <p><i>Her Son</i> (<i>gloomily</i>). Cost? Why, about two days'
    pay for every man in the Service!</p>

    <p><i>His Mother</i>. Well, I call it a shame for the Army to
    be fleeced for <i>that</i> thing. Are those creatures intended
    for mermaids, with their tails curled round that glass ball, I
    wonder? [<i>She sniffs.</i></p>

    <p><i>Her Daughter</i>. I expect it will be crystal,
    Mother.</p>

    <p><i>Her Mother</i>. Very likely, my dear, but&mdash;glass or
    crystal&mdash;<i>I</i> see no sense in it!</p>

    <p><i>Daughter</i>. Oh, it's absurd, of course&mdash;still,
    this figure isn't badly done, is it supposed to represent St.
    GEORGE carrying the Dragon? Because they've made the Dragon no
    bigger than a salmon!</p>

    <p><i>Mother</i>. Ah, well, I hope HER MAJESTY will be better
    pleased with it than I am, that's all.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>After which they fall into ecstasies over an
        industrial exhibit, consisting of a drain-pipe, cunningly
        encrusted with fragments of regimental mess-china set in
        gilded cement.</i></p>

        <p><i>Before a large mechanical clock, representing a
        fortress, which is striking. Trumpets sound, detachments of
        wooden soldiers march in and out of gateways, and parade
        the battlements, clicking, for a considerable time</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>A Spectator</i> (<i>with a keen sense of the fitness of
    things</i>). What&mdash;all that for on'y 'alf-past five!</p>

    <h4>OVERHEARD IN THE AMBULANCE DEPARTMENT.</h4>

    <p><i>Spectators</i> (<i>passing in front of groups of models
    arranged in realistic surroundings</i>). All the faces screwed
    up to suffering, you see!... What a nice patient expression
    that officer on the stretcher has! Yes, they've given
    <i>him</i> a wax head&mdash;some of them are only <i>papier
    m&acirc;ch&eacute;</i>.... Pity they couldn't get nearer their
    right size in 'elmets, though, ain't it?... There's <i>one</i>
    chap's given up the ghost!... I know that stuffed
    elephant&mdash;he comes from the Indian Jungle at the
    Colinderies!... I <i>do</i> think it's a pity they couldn't get
    something more <i>like</i> a mule than this wooden thing! Why,
    it's quite <i>flat</i>, and it's ears are only leather, nailed
    on!... You can't tell, my dear; it may be a peculiar breed out
    there&mdash;cross between a towel-horse and a donkey-engine,
    don't you know!</p>

    <h4>IN THE INDIAN JUNGLE SHOOTING-GALLERY.</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>At the back, amidst tropical scenery, an endless
        procession of remarkably undeceptive rabbits of painted tin
        are running rapidly up and down an inclined plane. Birds
        jerk painfully through the air above, and tin rats, boars,
        tigers, lions, and ducks, all of the same size, glide
        swiftly along grooves in the middle distance. In front,
        Commissionnaires are busy loading rifles for keen
        sportsmen, who keep up a lively but somewhat ineffective
        fusillade.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>'Arriet</i> (<i>to</i> 'ARRY). They 'ave got it up
    beautiful, I must say. Do you <i>get</i> anything for 'itting
    them?</p>

    <p><i>'Arry</i>. On'y the honour.</p>

    <p><i>A Father</i> (<i>to intelligent Small Boy, in rear of
    Nervous Sportsman</i>). No, I ain't seen him 'it anything
    <i>yet</i>, my son; but you <i>watch</i>. That's a rabbit he's
    aiming at now.... Ah, <i>missed</i> him!</p>

    <p><i>Small Boy</i>. 'Ow d'yer <i>know</i> what the gentleman's
    a-aiming at, eh, Father?</p>

    <p><i>Father</i>. 'Ow? Why, you notice which way he points his
    gun.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The N.S. fires again&mdash;without results.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Small Boy</i>. I sor that time, Father. He was a-aiming
    at one o' them ducks, an' he missed a rabbit! [<i>The N.S.
    gives it up in disgust.</i></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Enter a small party of 'Arries in high
        spirits.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>First 'Arry</i>. 'Ullo! <i>I</i>'m on to this. 'Ere,
    Guv'nor, 'and us a gun. <i>I</i>'ll show yer 'ow to shoot!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He takes up his position, in happy unconsciousness
        that playful companions have decorated his coat-collar
        behind with a long piece of white paper.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Second 'Arry.</i> Go in, JIM! You got yer markin'-paper
    ready, anyhow.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Delighted guffaws from the other 'Arries, in
        which</i> JIM <i>joins vaguely.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Third 'Arry</i>. I'll lay you can't knock a rabbit
    down!</p>

    <p><i>Jim</i>. I'll lay I can!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Fires. The procession of rabbits goes on
        undisturbed.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Second 'Arry</i> (<i>jocosely</i>). Never mind. You
    <i>peppered</i> 'im. I sor the feathers floy!</p>

    <p><i>Third 'Arry.</i> You'd ha' copped 'im if yer'd bin a bit
    quicker.</p>

    <p><i>Jim</i> (<i>annoyed</i>). They keep on movin' so, they
    don't give a bloke no chornce!</p>

    <p><i>Second 'Arry.</i> 'Ave a go at that old owl.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Alluding to a tin representation of that fowl which
        remains stationary among the painted rushes.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Third 'Arry.</i> No&mdash;see if you can't git that
    stuffed bear. He's on'y a yard or two away!</p>

    <h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Type Writer.</i>)</h4>

    <h4>No. XV.&mdash;THE JACK OF ALL JOURNALISMS.</h4>

    <p>In order to become a successful Journalist of a certain
    sort, it is only necessary that a man should in early life
    provide himself with a front as brazen as the trumpet which he
    blows to announce to the world his merits and his triumphs. It
    is, of course, essential that he should rid himself of any
    trace of sensitiveness that may remain to him after a youth
    about which the only thing certain is its complete obscurity,
    in order that no hint may be sufficiently broad to fit in with
    the tolerant breadth of his impudence, and no affront
    sufficiently pointed to pierce the skin with which Nature and
    his own industry have furnished him. Literary culture must be
    eschewed, for with literary culture come taste and
    discrimination&mdash;qualities which might fatally obstruct the
    path of this journalistic aspirant. For it must be assumed that
    in some of its later developments journalism has entirely cast
    off the reticence and the modesty which successive generations
    of censors have constantly held to have been characteristic of
    an age that is past. Indeed, while it is established that in
    1850 the critics of the day fixed their thoughts with pleasure
    on the early years of the century, though they found nothing
    but abuse for the journalism of their own time, it is curious
    to note that many of those who hurl the shafts of ridicule and
    contempt at the present period have only words of praise for
    1850. Without, however, going so far as these stern descendants
    of CATO, it may be affirmed that the porpoise-hided Jack of all
    Journalisms, as we know him, never had a greater power, nor
    exercised it over a larger scope with smaller scruple than
    to-day.</p>

    <p>It has been already said that the youth of the Jack of all
    Journalisms is lost in obscurity. It is obvious that he cannot
    have acquired his readiness of pen without much practice, but
    where the practice was obtained is a puzzle to which each of
    his enemies has a different key. Some say of him that he spent
    a year or two at a University, where he was noted for the
    unfailing regularity with which he sought the society of the
    wealthy, imbibed strong drinks, and omitted to pay his debts.
    It is also alleged that he started a colourable University
    imitation of the journal which happened at that particular time
    to be the most highly coloured in London, and that, after
    struggling through two numbers of convulsive scurrility, the
    infant effort withered under the frown of the Authorities, who
    at the same time sent its founder down. Others, however,
    declare him to have been the offspring of a decayed purveyor of
    spurious racing intelligence, who naturally sent his son to
    shift for himself after he had lost his last shirt in betting
    against one of his own prophecies. Others again aver, and
    probably with equal accuracy, that he was at no time other than
    what he is when the world first becomes aware of his
    existence&mdash;the blatant, cringing, insolent, able and
    disreputable wielder of a pen which draws much of its sting and
    its profit from the vanities and fears of his fellow-creatures.
    Be that as it may, he somehow becomes a power. He attaches
    himself to many journals, the editors of which he first
    pesters, afterwards serves, and always despises. He may perhaps
    have dabbled in music, and caused a penniless friend who is
    musical to write for small pay songs which he honours by
    attaching his own name to them as their composer. Woe betide
    the unhappy aspirant to the honours of public singing who
    ignores the demand of this quasi-musical Turpin that she should
    sing his songs. For, having become in the meantime a musical
    critic, he will devote all his talents to the congenial task of
    abusing her voice in his organ&mdash;which is naturally the
    more powerful instrument of the two. Should she, however,
    submit to his extortionate requests, he will deem himself
    entitled to embitter the rest of her existence with his
    patronising commendation.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/16.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/16.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>However, before reaching this pitch, he will have made his
    mark as an interviewer and a picturesque social reporter. In
    the former capacity he will have hunted momentary celebrities
    into the sanctity of their rooms, whence, after exchanging two
    words with them, he will have emerged with two columns of
    conversation. In the latter capacity, he will create for
    himself and the readers of his paper a social circle, the
    members of which, bear the same relation to Society proper as a
    lurcher does to a pure-bred greyhound. For there are many
    so-called social sets which are select merely because few
    desire to enter and many to leave them, and to these the Jack
    of all Journalisms is often a prophet and a leader pointing the
    way to the promised land. Thus we learn, with surprise, at
    first, and afterwards with the yawn that comes of the constant
    repetition of an ascertained fact, that the receptions of Lady
    TIFFIN are a model of all that is elegant and
    <i>recherch&eacute;</i>, whilst the dresses and jewels of Mrs.
    JIFFS are always a subject of enthusiastic admiration to those
    amongst whom she moves; and it is only in moments of peculiar
    moroseness that we remember that neither of these two ladies is
    qualified by position or refinement for anything more than a
    passing smile. Yet to many, the mere fact that they are
    mentioned in paragraphs, is proof positive of their descent
    from the VERE DE VERES.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the Jack of Journalisms will, at one time or
    another, have risen from the position of one who chronicles
    second-rate shows in remote corners of his paper, to be the
    recognised dramatic critic of a powerful organ. He thus
    acquires an extraordinary influence which he consolidates
    amongst outsiders by occasional lapses into a fury of critical
    honesty and abuse. It may be said of him, indeed, that, "Hell
    hath no fury like a critic scorned," for if he should, on any
    occasion, have taken umbrage at the treatment accorded to him
    by an actor or a manager, he will never allow the offence to
    fade, so long as he can fashion insinuations, misconstrue
    motives, or manufacture failure with his pen.</p>

    <p>In appearance the Jack of all Journalisms is not altogether
    pleasing. His early struggles against irresponsive editors have
    left their mark upon him, for having been compelled to seek
    consolation for disappointment by indulging in strong drinks,
    he never completely loses the habit which tells, of course,
    both upon his dress and temper. Though success, by bringing the
    pleasures of the table within his reach, has increased the
    rotundity of his figure, it has never been able to make his
    collars snowy or his conversation refined. He is often found
    upon the Committees of new Clubs which start with a blare of
    journalistic trumpets upon a chequered existence, only to
    perish in contempt a few years afterwards. But while they last
    he attends them in the hope of picking up a friend who may be
    valuable, or some gossip which he may turn to account. As a
    rule, he affects the society of those who are intellectually
    dull in order that he may pass with them for a man of immense
    culture and unfathomable sagacity. Over the third long drink
    provided for him by an admiring associate of this sort, he will
    grow eloquent, and his conversation will sparkle with
    reminiscences of leading articles he may once have written, and
    anticipations of others that he proposes to write. Those who
    hear him on such occasions will opine that he is a man of
    genius, who is only prevented by the carelessness of a Gallio
    from becoming a statesman of the first rank.</p>

    <p>A little later he will rise still higher, and will become
    the almost recognised medium through which really fashionable
    intelligence is converted into common knowledge. In this
    position he will allow nothing to escape him, and if one of the
    highest persons in the land should invite six friends to
    dinner, their names will on the following morning be known to
    the Jack of all Journalisms. It is unnecessary to say that in
    the course of this career he acquires, not only notoriety, but
    enemies, who watch eagerly for the false step that shall bring
    him to the ground. In spite of his craft, he is inevitably
    driven from boldness into rashness, and after waging a
    fruitless war against rascals more accomplished than himself,
    he, with a courage that scarcely atones for his imprudence,
    enters the witness-box, and, a flood of light having been
    thrown upon his past career, he finds himself for two nights
    blazoned in enormous letters on the posters of the evening
    papers, and is compelled, in the end, to submit to an adverse
    verdict, and to retire, "it may be for years or it may be for
    ever," from the open practice of a profession in which he had
    so distinguished himself.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>The Baron begs to acknowledge the receipt of a delightful
    book entitled, <i>Bordeaux et ses Vins</i> (<i>Cinqui&egrave;me
    &eacute;dition</i>!) <i>Class&eacute;s par Ordre de
    M&eacute;rite</i>, written by M. EDOUARD FERRET, and enriched
    with 225 views of vine-culturing Ch&acirc;teaux, by M. EUGENE
    VERGIZ. It is published by G. MASSON, Boulevard Saint Germain
    120, and now the Baron has placed it within reach of all the
    world. This particular volume was presented to the Baron by
    Messrs. HANKEY, BANNISTER &amp; Co., who succeeded to the
    business of TOD HEATLEY &amp; Co. (why was there never a Scotch
    firm of TODDY DRINKLEY &amp; Co.?) Judging from a few casual
    dips into its contents, it will evidently afford him some
    interesting half-hours with the best <i>crus</i>. The
    <i>connoisseur</i> in claret should go right through the book
    until he comes to "<i>Entre-deux-mers</i>," by which time he
    will be as wise and as ready as was SOLOMON, <i>entre deux
    m&egrave;res</i>, to pronounce judgment. The history of the
    Pape Clement wine takes us back to 1305, and is correctly told;
    but the Baron doubts whether M. FERRET has ferreted out the
    real story of the Ch&acirc;teau Haut-Brion. The fact is, that
    about the Twelfth Century, Seigneur THE BARON O'BRIEN from
    County Clare&mdash;which, as you see, only requires a "t" to
    make "Clare" into "Claret"&mdash;became the happy possessor of
    this elegant vine-growing district. The Baron O'BRIEN having
    taken a great deal of trouble about the good of his body, was
    one day struck by the remark, "<i>in vino veritas</i>," and
    thought he would do something for the good of his soul. So he
    founded a Mission, <i>La Mission O'Brien</i>, and then died in
    the odour of the most celebrated <i>crus</i>. On his tomb were
    the simple words, "<i>Il crut</i>." In the course of time,
    grass grew over the stone, the Mission moved, sold the
    property, and another family of Irish descent, O'BLIVION, would
    have wiped out every memorial of the original pious founder,
    had it not been for the peasantry, who had Gallicised O'BRIEN
    into HAUT BRION, under which name it has been known for the
    last two centuries. If this is not the veracious history of
    this celebrated wine, the Baron would like to know what is? How
    sensible to give an order of merit to the best Claret-grower.
    Two Barons of the House of ROTHSCHILD are thus distinguished.
    It was after trying many other Clarets that Baron JAMES turned
    to Barons ALPHONSE GUSTAVE and EDMOND DE ROTHSCHILD, and
    uttered the memorable words, "<i>Revenons &agrave; nos
    moutons</i>." It is a fascinating work, and the Baron has only
    just put down these few notes as an instalment of a grand book
    on wines, wine-growers, and wine-drinkers of all countries,
    which he is on the point of bringing out, entitled <i>Folks and
    Grapes</i>.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The Baron likes persons who take a hint kindly and act on it
    sensibly. He says this <i>&agrave; propos</i> of the Hairless
    Paper-pad Holder, the bald idea of which was suggested in
    <i>Mr. Punch's</i> pages. The paper-pad will be found most
    useful to travelling writers who use ink, and those authors
    whom gout, or some other respectable ailment, compels to work
    recumbently in bed or on sofa. The writer in bed, with ink
    handy, has only to take up his pad in one hand and his pen in
    the other, and as sheet after sheet is covered&mdash;sheets of
    paper <i>bien entendu</i>&mdash;he tears it off, and dries it
    at once on the blotter, which forms a portion of the pad. For
    Mr. GLADSTONE, when he is once again Prime Minister, the
    <i>Hairless Paper-pad</i> will be invaluable, as he can place
    it comfortably on his knee, write his despatch to HER MAJESTY,
    and blot it without distraction. As a writer of considerable
    practical experience, the Baron DE BOOK-WORMS strongly
    recommends the Hairless Paper-pad, which he will leave as a
    Hairloom to his family.</p>

    all about it, yet it is just the sort of book (yet it isn't
    exactly a book) that might have deeply interested the Hatter
    and the March Hare, and LEWIS CARROLL'S Snark Hunters, and
    suggested many deep questions to the inquiring mind of <i>Alice
    in Wonderland</i>. As a really humorous production, capable of
    affording amusement for many a weary hour, it may be safely
    recommended to parties in country houses during an
    exceptionally rainy season.</p>

    <p>THE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;My faithful "Co." has been reading <i>The Lazy
    Tour of Two Idle Apprentices, No Thoroughfare</i>, and <i>The
    Perils of Certain English Prisoners</i>, the joint work of
    CHARLES DICKENS and WILKIE COLLINS, and now published for the
    first time in a single volume. He says that the book is
    instructive, inasmuch as it shows the growth of its authors'
    collaboration. When the writers started <i>The Lazy Tour</i>
    they were, so to speak, like the gentleman seated one day at
    the organ, "weary and ill at ease;" they grew more accustomed
    to one another during <i>The Perils</i>, and attained
    perfection in <i>No Thoroughfare</i>. This last novel shows no
    traces of dual workmanship, and might have been the outcome of
    a single pen. My "Co." has but one fault to find with Messrs.
    CHAPMAN AND HALL (Limited)&mdash;he says that the stories
    deserved better illustrations.</p>

    <h2>HENLEY REGATTA.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's own Rowing Man.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>Henley, Monday</i>.</p>

    <p>I have arrived, and Henley once more is Henley. Even the
    weather has recognised me, and good old Plu himself came out to
    shake me by the hand and talk of old times. The course is of
    the usual length, but a slight alteration has been made in the
    breadth. Many house-boats are moored along the Oxfordshire
    bank. The bridge has not changed its position since I saw it
    last. The courteous Secretary of the Regatta assured me, that
    my complaint with reference to the impediment which this
    structure offers to rowing-boats had been laid before the
    Stewards. No action, however, is to be taken this year.</p>

    <p>This being the day before the Regatta, very heavy work was
    done by all the crews engaged in the race for the Grand
    Challenge Cup. They all have a good chance, and, personally, I
    should not feel the least surprise if I saw at least two eights
    rowing in the final heat on Thursday. Thames, London,
    Brasenose, Kingston, New College, and Trinity Hall all possess
    some "sterling oarsmen," and carry "banners" of different
    colours. I may remark, in passing, that no crew is allowed to
    row with more than eight oars.</p>

    <p>The race for the Stewards will be exciting. All these
    officials are in hard training, but the Mayor of Henley is
    favourite at short odds.*</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>*<i>Note by the Editor.</i>&mdash;Are you sure this is
        right?</p>

        <p><i>Reply.</i>&mdash;Right? Of course it is. I'm here,
        and I ought to know.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I notice that the Ladies have a race all to themselves.
    Doubtless this is due to Miss FAWCETT's pernicious example, but
    the innovation is not to be commended. The entries for the
    Visitors are of average quality. Three visitors only are to
    compete over a course of picnic luncheons and strawberries and
    cream. I have only room left to remark that the weather has
    been changeable, and that all the above tips are to be
    thoroughly relied upon.</p>

    the United Service, or a Member of one of the Inns of
    Court?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Because I fear that as a man of neither birth nor
    breeding, I should be regarded with contempt in either the Camp
    or the Forum.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Would you take a clerkship in the City?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Not willingly, as I have enjoyed something better
    than a commercial education, besides City clerkships are not to
    be had for the asking.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Well, would you become a shop-boy or a
    counter-jumper?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Certainly not; I should deem it a sin to waste my
    accomplishments (which are many) in filling a situation
    suggestive of the servants' hall, rather than of the
    library.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Well then, how are you to make an honest
    livelihood?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Those who are responsible for my education must
    answer that question.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> And if they can't?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Then I must accept an alternative, and seek
    inspiration and precedents from the records of success in
    another walk of life, beginning with the pages of the
    <i>Newgate Calendar!</i></p>

    <h2>REALLY ENTERTAINING.</h2>

    <p>Capital entertainment the GERMAN REEDS have just now. Mr.
    ALFRED REED immensely funny in <i>Carnival Time</i>, written by
    MALCOLM WATSON and CORNY GRAIN. You should have heard Miss
    NELLIE FARREN'S hearty laughter at the drolleries in St.
    George's Hall last Thursday afternoon. NELLY FARREN'S as good
    an audience as she is a comic actress, and that's saying a good
    deal. Miss FANNY HOLLAND and Miss KATE TULLY excellent. Then,
    after the <i>Carnival</i>, CORNY GRAIN'S <i>Society Peepshow
    for 1890</i> sent everybody into fits. That austere Indian
    Judge, Mr. Justice STRAIGHT, was straight no longer, but bent
    double by convulsions of laughter. Mr. CORNY GRAIN deals out
    pleasantly some hard bits all round, but as everyone applies
    them to his or her neighbour, everyone naturally enjoys the
    joke immensely. We used the word "drolleries" just now. Happy
    Thought; As we have had the Fisheries, and the Sogeries, and
    any number of other "eries," why not re-name St. George's Hall
    "The Drolleries?" Advice gratis:&mdash;Before the Season's
    over, it is a place to spend a happy afternoon or evening. As
    <i>Hamlet</i>, if he had thought of it, would have said to
    <i>Ophelia</i>, "Go! to the Drolleries! Go!"</p>

    <h2>A DIALOGUE UP TO DATE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>With some Remarks on the Importance of Talking an
    infinite deal of Nothing</i>.)</h4>

    <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>A Room</i>, PERSONS&mdash;GILNEST <i>and</i>
    ERBERT.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[For further details, See Mr. OSCAR WILDE'S Article in
        <i>The Nineteenth Century</i> for July.]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Erbert</i> (<i>at the banjo</i>). My dear GILLIE, what
    are you doing?</p>

    <p><i>Gilnest</i> (<i>yawning</i>). I was wondering when you
    were going to begin. We have been sitting here for an hour, and
    nothing has been said upon the important subject we proposed to
    discuss.</p>

    <p><i>E.</i> (<i>tapping him lightly on the cheek</i>). Tut,
    tut, my dear boy, you must not be petulant. And yet, when I
    come to study you more closely, your face looks charming when
    you make a <i>moue</i>. Let me see you do it again. Ah, yes.
    You look into my eyes with the divine sullenness that broods
    tragically upon the pale brow of the Antinous. And through your
    mind, though you know it not (how indeed should you?), march
    many mystical phantoms that are not of this base world. Pale
    HELEN steps out upon the battlements and turns to FLAUBERT her
    appealing glance, and CELLINI paces with Madame DE
    SEVIGN&Eacute; through the eternal shadows of unrevealed
    realism. And BROWNING, and HOMER, and MEREDITH, and OSCAR WILDE
    are with them, the fleet-footed giants of perennial youth, like
    unto the white-limbed Hermes, whom Polyxena once saw, and
    straight she hied her away to the vine-clad banks of Ilyssus,
    where Mr. PATER stands contemplative, like some mad scarlet
    thing by DVOR&Aacute;K, and together they march with the
    perfect significance of silence through realms that are
    cloud-capped with the bright darkness that shines from the
    poet's throne amid the stars.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Stops, and lights a cigarette.</i></p>

    <p><i>G.</i> Oh, beautiful, beautiful! Now indeed I recognise
    my ERBERT's voice; and that is&mdash;yes, it must be&mdash;the
    scent of the cigarettes you lately imported. Grant me one, only
    one. (<i>Takes one and lights it.</i>) But what were you
    talking about?</p>

    <p><i>E.</i> (<i>pinches his cheek</i>). There you are horrid
    again. But you smile. <i>Je te connais, mon brave.</i>
    &Gamma;&iota;&gamma;&nu;&omega;&sigma;&kappa;&omega;
    &sigma;&epsilon; &pi;&alpha;&iota; (never mind the accents).
    <i>Ich kenne dich, mein alter.</i> <i>Cognosco te, amice.</i> I
    know you, old fellow. You are only chaffing. As if you had not
    discovered that which all truly great indolence has taught ever
    since the first star looked out and beheld chaotic vastness on
    every hand. For to say something is what every puny whipster
    can do. To talk much, and in many languages, and yet to have
    said nothing, that, my dear GILLIE, is what all have striven
    for, but only one, gifted above his fellows with magic power of
    weaving the gossamer thread of words, has truly attained. For
    it is in that reconcilement of apparent opposites, and in the
    cadenced measures of a musical voice, that the dignified
    traditions of an &aelig;sthetic purity, repellent to the thin,
    colourless lips of impotence, reside and make their home.
    But&mdash; [<i>Breaks off, and lights a cigarette.</i></p>

    feather," as he has never shown it. Some people looked upon it

    <h2>ELECTROPHONOSCOPIC CHAT.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A little of it, picked up at the Office.</i> A.D.
    1900.)</h4>

    <p>There must surely be some mistake. Here, what's this? This
    old toothless hag, without her wig, is unknown to me! And why
    does she address me as "ARCHIBALD"? I was expecting to see my
    beloved ARAMINTA.</p>

    <p>Excuse me, but I think we have been wrongly switched on.
    From your description you seem to be having the interview I was
    expecting with my dear good Grandmother. While this charming
    young Lady&mdash;But perhaps you would like to see for
    yourself?</p>

    <p>A thousand thanks! It is my own ARAMINTA! Pray let us change
    places, and allow me to resign you your good Grandmother at
    once.</p>

    <p>Ha! why does that poor Gentleman turn faint and stagger
    towards the door in search of a little air? Let us ask the
    Postmistress.</p>

    <p>She says he has just concluded a terrible interview with his
    Wife's mother. But see, he has recovered himself and struck an
    attitude of defiance. That at least, at the other end, will
    impress her.</p>

    <p>See how that Stockbroker is leaping with delight! And no
    wonder. He has just been electrophonoscopically attending the
    "Illinois Central" half-yearly meeting at New York, and, having
    speculated for the rise, finds that he has made a pot of
    money.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, June 30</i>.&mdash;Wanting to
    know about Heligoland in the Lords. ROSEBERY inquires
    especially how population like the change?</p>

    <div class="figright"

        <a href="images/23-1.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="" /></a>The Exile from Erin. (Just arrived in
             Holyhead.)
    </div>

    <p>"Oh, that's all right," said the MARKISS; "if there's one
    thing the Heligolanders have been pining for since date of
    their birth, it is for union with Germany. If we'd only been
    generous, we ought to have gratified their desire long ago. I
    don't wish to touch on controversial matters, but I must say if
    the Government, of which my noble friend was an ornament, had,
    when in office, only ceded Heligoland to Germany, they would
    have deserved well of their country, and might have been
    assured of the enthusiastic support of noble Lords on this side
    of the House, and of the Party of which my nephew is a Leader
    in another place. It is impossible for me, without making your
    Lordships late for dinner, a crime from which I trust to hold
    my conscience free, fully to set forth the universal advantage
    that arises from this stroke of policy. It pleases everybody,
    especially the Heligolanders."</p>

    <p>ROSEBERY persistent; wants to know what means were taken to
    obtain the opinion of the population, and elicit this paean of
    joy?</p>

    <p>"Oh!" said the MARKISS, "obviously, they are documents of a
    confidential nature."</p>

    <p>"Confidential with the population?" asks GRANVILLE, in
    softest tones, with bewitching smile, and most deferential
    manner. For once the MARKISS has no retort ready. Lords sit
    silent for moment, awaiting answer; none forthcoming; LORD
    CHANCELLOR, with great presence of mind, proposes "that this
    House do now adjourn." Agreed to, and Lords go forth, each
    seeing in his mind's eye the MARKISS in confidential
    communication with the population of Heligoland, laboriously
    and conscientiously ascertaining their views, individual and
    aggregate, on question of transfer.</p>

    <p>"The MARKISS is quite right," said ASHBOURNE, looking in
    from his honourable exile in Dublin; "you can't, I know, frame
    an indictment against a nation. But you can certainly enter
    into confidential communication with a population. Capital
    copyhead it would make for OLD MORALITY: <i>Confidential
    Communications Corrupt Good Heligolanders</i>."</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;"Wish you'd get yourself made a Peer,
    TOBY," said DENMAN, gloomily. "Not difficult, I understand;
    BRABOURNE will tell you how it's done; unlike the Poet, a Peer
    is either born or made; AYLESBURY, for example, was born;
    BRABOURNE was made. As you weren't born, you must be made.
    Baron BOUVERIE-STREET would look very well in the Peerage.
    You've only to ask (BRABOURNE knows); keep on asking, and in
    meantime make yourself disagreeable in the Commons, and the
    thing is done."</p>

    <p>Very much obliged to DENMAN; quite kind of him to take this
    interest in me; but why so anxious on the point?</p>

    <p>"I'll tell you frankly, TOBY. I want to create a Party here,
    and you'd do admirably to begin with. A Statesman, however
    capable, no use without a Party. You know that very well in the
    Commons. Everybody there has a Party. I am all by myself here,
    and the MARKISS and the rest put upon me. Now if I had a
    Party&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"HANS BREITMANN had one, you know," I say, liking to humour
    DENMAN, who is evidently in low spirits.</p>

    <p>"Had he? Where did he sit for? Never heard of him; however,
    as I was saying, if I had a Party I should make the MARKISS sit
    up."</p>

    <p>In the meantime, I gather they have been making DENMAN sit
    down. Debate on about Sheriff's Assizes Expenses Bill. DENMAN
    had something useful to say. Approached table; ESHER got up at
    same moment. Peers impatiently called for ESHER; DENMAN ignored
    petty insult; commenced his speech; sentences drowned in
    hubbub; ESHER resumed seat; MARKISS approached table; DENMAN
    drew himself up to full height, and glared on MARKISS. Knew of
    old his jealousy of him; stops at no means of gratifying it;
    now moves, "That Lord ESHER be heard." LORD CHANCELLOR, that
    minion of the majority, promptly puts question, and declares it
    carried. For a moment DENMAN stands irresolutely at table,
    looking round. Suppose he were to lightly skip on to table,
    and, standing there, defy them all? Suppose he were to lower
    his head, and run a-butt at the stomach of the LORD CHANCELLOR?
    What delight to topple him over&mdash;to see his heels rise in
    the air, and disappear with rest of his body at other side of
    Woolsack! DENMAN laughed to think he should see such fun.
    Content for the present with contemplation of it, and so
    resumed seat. "But I'll form a Party," said he; "have my own
    Whips, and shake this effete Government to its foundation."</p>

    <p>"You may," he moans, "write on the front of the Bill,
    '<i>Delendum est Londinium</i>,' um? um?" He, for one, will
    have no responsibility in the matter; and so, tucking his hands
    under his coat-tails, he strides forth, to vote against Third

    <p>The announcement that a Thousand Nurses would be received at
    Marlborough House last Saturday, naturally attracted a large
    number of the Guards and Household troops, who were off duty,
    to the vicinity of St. James's Park and Pall Mall. The
    excitement among the military somewhat abated when it was
    ascertained that the Prince and Princess were receiving the
    "first working subscribers" to the National Pension Fund for
    Nurses. The Prince made one of his best speeches, and the
    Princess smiled her best smiles. The Comptroller of the Weather
    for the Royal Household had given special orders for sunshine,
    or a good imitation of it from one till three, so umbrellas
    were not needed; thus symbolically showing that the day of
    "Gamps" was over, and that a new era of superior nursing was
    now an established fact. If such a state of affairs had
    continued as was portrayed in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>, their
    Royal Highnesses might have been receiving the last thousand
    <i>Sarah Gamps</i> and <i>Betsy Prigs</i>, and addressing them
    in a very different strain.</p>

    several sealed bottles of this unique preparation, and, as far
    as I can make out, I have no hesitation in saying that its
    claim to contain in every single teaspoonful 'all the active
    principle of two bottles of "'36" champagne, five pounds of
    pork chops, a pint of train oil, a tinned lobster, a pot of

    prescribed it for any of my own patients, but, if I find my
    practice inconveniently extended, I shall probably do so."</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
